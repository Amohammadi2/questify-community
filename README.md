## Cloning the Repo

```bash
# Using https
$ git clone https://github.com/Amohammadi2/questify-community.git
# Using ssh
$ git clone git@github.com:Amohammadi2/questify-community.git
```

If you prefer to use https, It's easier to use GCM or Git Credential Manager. When you try to perform operations that do require authentication, GCM will prompt you to authenticate through your browser and stores your credentials so that you won't have to authenticate again the next time.

Keep in mind that GCM **does not** handle SSH Keys, SSH connection is managed by SSH Client and your SSH keys are managed by SSH Agent.

* [Connecting to Github with SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)
